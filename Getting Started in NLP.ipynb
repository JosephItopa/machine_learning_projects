It is imported like any other library in Python is, and with it, we can construct what is called a *client*. If you've never used service SDKs like this before, the concept of a \"client\" will come up a lot. In short, a client is an object that we provide some basic information such as AWS region and what service we want. This object then will have easy-to-use functions for each thing we'd like to do.\n",
